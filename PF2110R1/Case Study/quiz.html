    <!--Scripts with the async attribute are executed asynchronously. 
        This means the script is executed as soon as it's downloaded, without blocking the browser in the meantime. 
        This implies that it's possible to script 2 is downloaded and executed before script 1.
    The current state-of-the-art is to put scripts in the <head> tag and use the async or defer attributes. 
        This allows your scripts to be downloaded ASAP without blocking your browser.
        The good thing is that your website should still load correctly on the 2% of browsers that do not support 
        these attributes while speeding up the other 98%.-->
